You are an expert Flutter developer.
Apply the following UI and logic changes to the Budget screen.
Follow the instructions precisely and keep the design consistent.

🔧 REQUIRED CHANGES
1. Total Monthly Budget Background Color

Change the background color of the Total Monthly Budget container/card to match the sidebar color exactly.

Ensure the padding, radius, and shadow remain consistent with the rest of the theme.

2. Improve UI Background Colors

Update the Total Spent and Remaining background colors to be cleaner, polished, and consistent with the global UI style.

Do NOT use arbitrary colors; use a balanced tone that harmonizes with the sidebar theme.

3. Add Dummy Data for Testing

Create a separate, clearly named dummy data file (e.g. lib/dummy/budget_dummy_data.dart).

Populate it with different scenarios so developers can test the progress bar states.

Make it easy to delete later.

Dummy data must include:

Low usage (under 50%)

Medium usage (50%–80%)

High usage (over 80%)

4. Budget Status Logic

For each category, apply the following logic based on spending vs. budget:

Status Rules

GOOD (Green) → spent < 50% of budget

WARNING (Yellow) → spent < 80% of budget

IN RISK (Red) → spent ≥ 80% of budget

Make sure:

The color reflects in the progress bar segment.

The status text changes accordingly.

The style (icon + color + text) stays consistent with the design.

5. Progress Bar Text

Remove the label “progress” completely from all progress bars.

Only show visual progress, percentage, and status if needed.

6. Currency Fix

Replace all “$” or “USD” references in the entire app with “DZD”.

Ensure no dollar symbol remains anywhere (inputs, labels, summaries, hints, calculations).

📌 NOTES

Keep the design consistent with Figma / previous guidelines.

Ensure changes do not break reactive Drift behavior.

Dummy data should not affect production data.

Use clean architecture (separate logic, UI, dummy data).
